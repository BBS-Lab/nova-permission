## Installation

You can install the nova tool in to a Laravel app that uses [Nova](https://nova.laravel.com) via composer:


``` bash
composer require bbs-lab/nova-permission
```

The service provider will automatically get registered. Or you may manually add the service provider in your `config/app.php` file:

```php
'providers' => [
    // ...
    BBSLab\NovaPermission\NovaPermissionServiceProvider::class,
],
```

You can publish the config files with:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="BBSLab\NovaPermission\NovaPermissionServiceProvider" --tag="config"
```

You should publish the migration with:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="BBSLab\NovaPermission\NovaPermissionServiceProvider" --tag="migrations"
```

This will publish `config/permission.php` and `config/nova-permission.php` files with the following contents:

```php
// config/permission.php
return [

    'models' => [

        /*
         * When using the "HasPermissions" trait from this package, we need to know which
         * Eloquent model should be used to retrieve your permissions. Of course, it
         * is often just the "Permission" model but you may use whatever you like.
         *
         * The model you want to use as a Permission model needs to implement the
         * `BBSLab\NovaPermission\Contracts\Permission` contract.
         */

        'permission' => BBSLab\NovaPermission\Models\Permission::class,

         *

         * Ideally, this should match your preferred way of checking permissions, eg:

         */

        'model_key' => 'name',

        /*
         * You may optionally indicate a specific cache driver to use for permission and
         * role caching using any of the `store` drivers listed in the cache.php config
         * file. Using 'default' here means to use the `default` set in cache.php.
         */

        'store' => 'default',
    ],
];
```

```php
// config/nova-permission
return [
    'authorizable_models' => [
        // \App\Models\Post::class,
    ],

    'generate_without_resources' => [
        \Laravel\Nova\Actions\ActionResource::class,
        \BBSLab\NovaPermission\Resources\Role::class,
        \BBSLab\NovaPermission\Resources\Permission::class,
    ]
];
```

After the migration has been published you can create the role- and permission-tables by running the migrations:

```bash
php artisan migrate
```

## Usage

You must register the tool with Nova. This is typically done in the `tools` method of the `NovaServiceProvider`:

```php
// app/Providers/NovaServiceProvider.php

public function tools()
{
    return [
        // ...
        new BBSLab\NovaPermission\PermissionBuilder(),
    ];
}
```

### Prevent role `override_permission` modification

You may prevent `override_permission` attribute modification by using the `BBSLab\NovaPermission\Resources\Role::canSeeOverridePermmission` method:

```php
// in a service provider

BBSLab\NovaPermission\Resources\Role::canSeeOverridePermmission(function (Request $request) {
    // implement your logic
});
```
